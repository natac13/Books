# The Three-Phase Synchronous Motor

### Author: Sean Campbell

**Construction**
The stator core is constructed with steel lamination, windings are placed into slots that are designed into the stator core. The windings of pole pairs are wound in such a way as to create opposing magnetic fields for each alternation of the three-phase supply current.
Field poles on the rotor are created with many turns of a small AWG wire. The field poles become electromagnets by running a D/C through the windings, which establishes solid north and south poles.
Two end shields, which house the bearings to support the shaft of the rotor are pressed onto the stator core, using heat to temporarily expand the metal. 
Brushes or a brush-less design can supply the D/C excitation. With the brush type, brushes, brush holders, slip rings and springs are utilized to excite the field poles. When of the brush-less variety (usually the case with larger synchronous motors) a smaller three-phase alternator attached to the motor's shaft is used. This will produce a three-phase current which is rectified by a three-phase bridge rectifier; yielding D/C excitation to the rotor field poles. There is also a switch used to turn the excitation current on or off. Connected across the field poles is a field discharge resistor when the switch is in the off position.
Instead of electromagnet field poles some synchronous motors use permanent magnetics to create to magnetic coupling between the stator's rotating magnetic field and the field poles of the rotor.


**Characteristics**
The synchronous motor will operate at a constant speed from no load to full load. This speed will be equal to synchronous speed of the motor's stator windings rotating magnetic field. Found with: frequency multiplied by a constant 120 and divided by the number of pole pairs per phase the motor has.

**Operation**
The synchronous motor required two power source for operation. One is a three-phase A/C power which is delivered to the stator windings. The second is a D/C excitation current need to established the fix field poles of the rotor (usually salient poles); these electromagnets equal in number to the stator poles.
The synchronous motor is not inherently self-starting, and required either a separate prime motor to bring it up to 95% synchronous speed before locking into synchronism by exciting the field poles. Or a much more common way is the use of a squirrel-cage, known as Amortisseur Windings. Bars of copper or aluminum placed into slots of the rotor core, on a diagonal, all shorted together by end rings on both sides. 


**D/C Excitation Circuit**
The circuit will consist of a rheostat or a voltage regulator so that the D/C excitation can be adjusted. Normal excitation is that amount of current to create a unity power factor at full load. On can over-excite or under-excite the excitation current to achieve a leading or lagging power factor respectively.
The excitation current is turned on at around 95% synchronous speed, but is to remain off upon startup. As the stators rotating magnetic field cuts the field pole windings of the rotor a voltage will be induced, which will be high since the field poles are wound with many turns of small copper wire. The voltage that is induced is limited by the field discharge resistor that is connected across (parallel to) to field pole windings. However the voltage can still reach a dangerous level and therefore the field pole terminals should be guarded from personal.
